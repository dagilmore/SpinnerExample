SpinnerExample
==============

This project is an example of using the [AndroidBuildSystemPlugin](https://github.com/manymo/AndroidBuildSystemPlugin)
for Manymo to run tests in the cloud.

Running this requires installing the [manymo command line tool](https://www.manymo.com/pages/documentation/manymo-command-line-tool), as well as
installing the authentication token.

Then, run the following command in the project's main directory:

```
    gradle manymoInstrumentTest
```
